# AWS_Helper
This project is about the concept of developing an AI system for the help for the usage of the AWS, similar to the Co-Pilot for the coding it helps for the AWS navigation for the easier method.

While AWS is the most used web service provider platform, it is quite complicated to navigate through the system, as it requires various pre-known knowledge realted to the service to be able to properly navigate through it. As it is a conceputal project where there is the possibility of checking whether the project could be developed as the two part solution to the problem of properly using and navigating through the AWS. It does have two parts,
- A Web browser extension which can overlay on the browser's webpages for the hints and processes to be done, while with the input field regarding what needs to be done.
- A proper backend system with various AI features which could understand the input what it means and how to perform it properly.

As this project is very complicated at first, while I think it could be done with some innovative methods and could help to reduce the time of using it and reading documentations regarding AWS.
